# Altice rant
Here, I'll roast Altice's awful UX. Featuring:
- `selfcare.altice.com.do`
- "Mi Altice" app

I'll roast the password-change process (no hints 💀), the "maintenance notice" that only shows up when you try to login, the confusing and overly "clean" UI of the app, etc...

Update: They turned the 4-digit requirement into a 6+ digit requirement (IIRC). They even forced users to reset their "passwords" (actually PIN) so that the new system could accept them. That was one of the many reasons I could never log-in.

The CAPTCHA was very insidious to me, as a uBlock-medium-mode user: it was **served by `www.google.com`**, how could I possibly guess that? There wasn't even a visual indicator that a CAPTCHA _should_ be there. I was expected to know that I should unblock a domain that's meant for _searching the web_. At least cloudflare has the decency to use an obvious `challenges.cloudflare.com` and it even says "Please unblock" when JS is enabled but the host is blocked!
