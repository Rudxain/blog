## Intro
Have you heard of [Last Thursdayism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism), [MUP](https://esolangs.org/wiki/My_Unreliable_Past), or ["Artificial" by DM25](https://youtu.be/ND0Lp9GcRzo)? If not, I recommend reading/watching those if you want to get existential crisis.

This blog-post is mostly philosophical. It's about sentience, awareness, emotions, ethics, morality, rights, theoretical computer science, and more. Prepare yourself for this journey...

## Body

Consider the following question: If you could magically change **anything** about your personality, identity, behavior, cognition, preferences, fears, superstitions, etc... (anything that comes from your brain) what would you change (and in what way)?

And if you choose to change something, can you predict what your future self will _actually_ do?

Essentially, this is the [reachability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reachability_problem) applied to [self-modifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code) human brains. Keep in mind (pun intended) that [brains already modify themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity), so this thought experiment (pun intended) allows your consciousness to easily change any part of your brain without the risks of surgeries or genetic-engineering.

But there are unforseen risks that come with this power
