# Reusable Terms and conditions
Here I'll lay-out my proposal for making human-friendly contracts, without sacrificing basic nuance.

This is a [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process), so please don't assume a finished state. Suggestions are welcome! (**warning:** I haven't chosen an open license, yet).

## Intro
You know what the following have in common:
- Licenses
- Terms and Conditions
- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Literally any sort of contract

But I'll outline them anyways, for emphasis:
- They're long and verbose
- They're filled with [legalese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_writing#Legalese)
- If they aren't verbose/legalese, they tend to be ambiguous
- They have similar glossaries, sentences, and even full paragraphs, in common with other legal documents of the same kind (sometimes even identical replicas!)
- It's hard to properly write one, so you either copy-paste a template or hire lawyer

The year is almost **2025 and humanity hasn't fixed this simple issue** for decades (**millennia**, if we're being unfair).

## Inspiration
The following is a list of resources to which I feel grateful:
- [Hyper-media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia) has already solved this for arbitrary content (information, misinformation ðŸ¤¡, raw data, graphics, audio, text, executables, etc...)
- [Nicky Case's "Nutshell"](https://ncase.me/nutshell) extends the concept of hyper-media to be more interactive. But this isn't a [Web Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards) or a [Web Browser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), yet...
- [SPDX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Package_Data_Exchange) has _mostly_ solved this for [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) licenses. If you want a modified version of a license, you must [inline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion) the full text anyways... ([square 1](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/back_to_square_one)).
- The [OpenPD](https://openpd.org/) aims to solve this for privacy-policies.
- There's [this paper about "Machine-Readable Privacy Notices"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386763). I haven't read it yet, I'm just referencing it.
- [This tool](https://rejectconvenience.com/privacy-visualizer) helps users "digest" privacy-policies, but doesn't solve the underlying problem.

## Why?
As a "layperson", you might wonder:
> why can't [orgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) and [corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) simply say
> "BTW, our terms are the same as Google's, except for this part"

The whole point of "legally-valid" contracts is that there should be no ambiguity, as any omitted detail could become a [loop-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loophole), which is equivalent to a [software vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computer_security)). That's the reason why there's so much legalese, because lawyers need to cover **everything** (every possible scenario in the past, present, and future), to protect the org from "abusive users" exploiting the holes.

This goes both ways: A "legal [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)" could be so unintentionally strict, that [100% of the target demographic would be forbidden from using the service](https://web.archive.org/web/20241008105526/https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/2656).
