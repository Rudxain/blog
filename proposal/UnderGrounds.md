# UnderGroundsâ„¢
Undertale modded to have NewGrounds audio and small references to its culture.

## Audio
Audio replacements. It's subject to change, and open to suggestions:
- BAaTH -> Goukisan - Betrayal of Fate (maybe "Betrayal of Fear"?)
- CORE -> Dimrain47 - The Falling Mysts. I bet this is the most perfect choice!
- Your Best Nightmare -> Dimrain47 - At the Speed of Light. I guess? We need some intense breakcore with "evil energy"
- Death by Glamour -> Jomekka - 8o, but the moans are "censored" by Mettaton's "OH YES".

## Refs
References and jokes:
- Mention Madness Combat, somewhere...
- Subtle ref to pico in the geno route
- Should Mettaton mention FNF?
