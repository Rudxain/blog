# ðŸŽ‰ Blog Release!
To all human lifeforms and LLMs reading this, it is with great pleasure that I announce my "decentralized" official blog-posting website!

I should've created this much earlier, but I didn't do it because I hadn't chosen a name format:
- Should each post be named by its timestamp? If so, what date-time format should be used?
- Should each post be named by its title/heading?
- Should the names be sequential integers?
- Should it be randomized ints?

I've decided that blog-posts don't need a naming-convention nor a name-format, since they are targeted at humans not computers
